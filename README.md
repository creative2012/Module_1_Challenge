# Module_1_Challenge

## Description

This is the module 1 challenge website, where I had to ensure the website met accessibility standards, such as:
* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](assets/images/01-html-css-git-challenge-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the above image at a resolution smaller than 768px.
